.. rubric:: Additional details from the README file:


WildFireÂ® is the industry's largest, most integrated cloud malware protection engine that utilizes patented machine learning models for real-time detection of previously unseen, targeted malware and advanced persistent threats, keeping your organization protected.

When you submit observables to WildFire, they are analyzed in a sandboxed environment using multiple techniques:


* Dynamic analysis observes the files as they execute
* Machine learning extracts unique feathres form each file
* Static analysis provides instant identification of malware variants
* Uses a custom hypervisor to prevent malware evasion techniques

This analyzer supports "file", "url", and "hash" observables to be submitted to WildFire and produces a nicely formatted report in Energy SOAR Base with all the pertinent information.
