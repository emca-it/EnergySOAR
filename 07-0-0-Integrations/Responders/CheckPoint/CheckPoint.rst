CkeckPoint
^^^^^^^^^^

This responder permits you to add/remove selected observable from a specific group. 

Some notes:

.. code-block::

   - API must permit access from cortex machine.

   - First login from API must be manual because it needs fingerprint acceptance. This will generate a fingerprints.txt file that must be placed near to the analyzer python file.

   - It doesn't work in dockerized analyzer!

   - If group doesn't exists it'll be created [when blocking]. At the moment without any default rule.

* ``server`` : URL of CheckPoint instance
