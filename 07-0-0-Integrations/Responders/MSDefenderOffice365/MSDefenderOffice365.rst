.. rubric:: Additional details from the README file:


Microsoft Defender for Office 365 safeguards your organization against malicious threats posed by email messages, links (URLs), and collaboration tools. Defender for Office 365 includes:


* Threat protection policies: Define threat-protection policies to set the appropriate level of protection for your organization.
* Reports: View real-time reports to monitor Defender for Office 365 performance in your organization.
* Threat investigation and response capabilities: Use leading-edge tools to investigate, understand, simulate, and prevent threats.
* Automated investigation and response capabilities: Save time and effort investigating and mitigating threats.

This responder implements support for the Tenant Allow/Block List which is used during mail flow for incoming messages to manually override the Microsoft 365 filtering verdicts. An observable with dataType 'mail' is used to block/unblock a sender, while dataType 'domain' is used to block/unblock a domain.

You can also block or unblock multiple entries at once by using a multi-line observable with one entry per line.

The configuration allows you to specify the number of days for a block entry to live before expiration with a value of 0 meaning no expiration.

For further reference on this capability, see the Microsoft documentation `Allow or block emails using the Tenant Allow/Block List <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/allow-block-email-spoof?view=o365-worldwide>`_.
